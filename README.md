# Read-and-Write-CSV-file-unzip-and-extract-particular-files
This code is based on 5 traffic data taken by speed detectors. 
It is an easy way to unzip a specific file with a specific extension (here .csv) 
Then, it changes the name of the file that is extracted (here it changes it to dates: the name of the original .zip in which it existed, 
so that we don't lose the date and time of the speed detector). 
In addition, write/read a CSV file. Creates a new .csv file, in which it writes data.
